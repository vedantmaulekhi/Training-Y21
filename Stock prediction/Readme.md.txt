Project Overview:-
In this assignment, we will be developing a Python program that predicts the closing prices of a given stock index for the next two days based on historical data.

Installation:-
We need to install many libraries and dependencies like :-
1) Matplotlib
2) Pandas
3) NumPy
4) TensorFlow
5) Scikit-learn

Usage:-
You need to run 211156_Vedant_Maulekhi.py on a compiler like vs_code and the predict function predicts 2 stock values and returns them and then the evaluate function calculates the M.S.E value and Directional Accuracy values and prints them. 
For me , for some reason the evaluate function was not working on my laptop, it was returning some shape error , but for the same python was run on other laptop it would return the m.s.e values and directional accuracy. I have included print(predicted_prices) which gives a list of 2 stock prices so please consider this.

Error I was getting :- ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (2,) + inhomogeneous part.
